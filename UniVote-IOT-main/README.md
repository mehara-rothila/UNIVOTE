# E-Voting System

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a secure and inclusive Electronic Voting System using web technologies and IoT components. The system addresses the threat of election fraud and ensures transparency, safety, and inclusivity in the voting process. It includes features such as biometric identification, secure data storage, real-time result reporting, and accessibility for voters with disabilities.

## Features

- **Secure Voter Registration**: Users register on a dedicated website using various identity verification methods (student IDs, fingerprints, face IDs, NIC/passport numbers).
- **Unique BARCODE Cards**: Each voter receives a unique barcode card to prevent impersonation.
- **Biometric Verification**: Fingerprint and face ID scanners are used for additional security.
- **Accessibility**: The system includes a "sip and puff" method for voters with restricted mobility.
- **Real-time Results**: Results are updated every 30 minutes on a dedicated website.
- **Set Voting Time**: A timer ensures that voting ends at a specified time, maintaining impartiality and precision.

## Components

- **Arduino Mega**: Central processing unit for the system.
- **BARCODE Card Reader**: Scans the barcode cards for voter identification.
- **Fingerprint Scanner**: Verifies voter identity.
- **Face ID Scanner**: Provides an additional layer of security.
- **Sip and Puff Interface**: Assists disabled voters.
- **LCD Display**: Displays the voting process and results.
- **Timer**: Ensures voting is conducted within a specific timeframe.

## System Design

The system integrates multiple hardware components with a web-based application. Voter data is securely stored and managed, ensuring the integrity of the voting process. The design also includes provisions for handling sensitive data and preventing tampering.
